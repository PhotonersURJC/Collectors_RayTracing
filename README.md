# Collectors_RayTracing
A Microsoft Excel tool to predict the radiation distribution in 2D collectors geometries, under different sun light incidence angles. It also calculates the Dynamic Concentration Factors of Incident radiation and flux, being the proportion between the average incident radiation inside the reactor and the flux reaching the collectors opening, and the same proportion but between fluxes (reaching the reactor and the opening). DCF for incident radiation is a very relevant parameter if collectors are used in photochemical processes, where not only the total amount of energy, but also the availability of photons running through the reactor are crucial for the determination of chemical kinetics.
